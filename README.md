The `org.lappsgrid.discriminator` package provides an inventory of the URI used by
LAPPS services. Most of the source code in this project is machine generated by the [Vocab DSL](https://github.com/lapps/vocabulary-pages) and
[Discriminator DSL](https://github.com/oanc/org.lappsgrid.discriminator.dsl) projects and should not be edited here.

The primary purpose of this module is to provide classes with `static final` definitions that IDEs can use for code completion and to provide meaningful tooltips.
